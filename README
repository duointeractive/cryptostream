Required Libraries:

Python Cryptography Toolkit
> easy_install pycrypto

Running:

Launch the main:app using gunicorn

> gunicorn main:app

Using:

Application does two things:

1.  Checks a timestamp to make sure the link was recently given to the user.
2.  Redirect user to a static URL without giving this URL to the user.

To encrypt a url for cryptostream to decode:

> from cryptostream.main import EncryptURL
> EncryptURL("/foo/bar/")
'path=SQkADU4QBx0%3D&ts=V11XVVFAVFlaVE9AUg%3D%3D'

Then add this querystring to the url cryptostream is running on.

Configure:

There are two variable in main.py that control behavior:

1. KEY = 'foobar'  # A Plain text encryption key
2. timedelta = datetime.timedelta(hours=4)  # Maximum time the link will be alive.

Sample Nginx Server Config:

server {
	listen   80 default;
	server_name  localhost;

	access_log  /var/log/nginx/localhost.access.log;

	# Serves up jpegs in my picture directory at root
	location ~ \.(jpg|JPG)$ {
		root   /home/dylan/Pictures;
	}

	# Gunicorn running the Cryptostream app
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
        }
}
