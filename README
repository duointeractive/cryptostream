Required Libraries:

Python Cryptography Toolkit
> easy_install pycrypto

Running:

Launch the main:app using gunicorn

> gunicorn main:app

Using:

Application does two things:

1.  Checks a timestamp to make sure the link was recently given to the user.
2.  Redirect user to a static URL without giving this URL to the user.

To encrypt a url for cryptostream to decode:

> from cryptostream.main import EncryptURL
> EncryptURL("/foo/bar/")
'path=SQkADU4QBx0%3D&ts=V11XVVFAVFlaVE9AUg%3D%3D'

Then add this querystring to the url cryptostream is running on.

Configure:

There are two variable in main.py that control behavior:

1. KEY = 'foobar'  # A Plain text encryption key
2. timedelta = datetime.timedelta(hours=4)  # Maximum time the link will be alive.
